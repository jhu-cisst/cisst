/*!
  \brief Class to manage the preparation of Python for the
  Interactive Robot Environment, and for launching the IRE IDE and
  shell.

  \ingroup cisstInteractive

  The goal of the IRE is to be mindlessly simple to incorporate in
  already complicated applications.

  The purpose of this class is to abstract the mechanics of preparing
  and launching Python in general and the IRE in particular from the
  end user.  It is also used to ensure creation of a single extended
  Python shell with global scope.

  This class is instantiated, and runs as a singleton object.  The
  method is borrowed from Design Principles and the CISST Logger.

  \note The IRE is *not* thread-safe; all threads will run the IRE in
  the Python shell created by this singleton class.  This behavior is
  DESIRED; we are attempting to prevent multiple copies of the Object
  Register from being created from within the same application.  Note
  that it is theoretically possible for the user to nevertheless
  create a new copy of the Object Register referenced by this
  application from within a separate Python shell (the IRE IDE permits
  spawning new shells).

	/*! Launches the IRE Python shell.

      The type of shell is specified by useIPython parameter:

         false ->  Starts the standard Python interpreter, loads the "irepy"
                   Python IRE package, which depends on wxPython, and calls
                   the "launch()" method to launch the GUI.

         true  ->  Starts the IPython shell instead of the "irepy" IRE (GUI).
                   IPython is an enhanced interactive Python shell, with
                   autocompletion, etc.

      \note Although the "irepy" package itself remains loaded for the
      duration of the application, any variables/objects instantiated
      within the IRE interpreter are contained in a separate,
      session-scope interpreter; they will not be available from the
      C++ environment after the IRE GUI is shut down.

	  The Python shell will first run the "startup" string.  This can
      be used, for example, to import application-specific Python scripts.
	  The "startup" string is not declared const because that would not
	  be compatible with PySys_SetArgv().

      If the newPythonThread parameter is true, the IRE will be started in
	  a separate thread.  Note, however, that the C++ code will have to
	  periodically call JoinIREShell(); otherwise, the C++ program will
	  not relinquish any execution time to the IRE thread.
	  An alternate implementation would be to create the IRE thread in
	  the C++ code before launching the IRE.  This, however, is less
	  portable and would best be implemented using cisstOSAbstraction.

      If the useStreambuf field is true, the IRE logger will show locally-generated
      log messages (using cmnCallbackStreambuf).  When using the system-wide logger,
      it is recommended to set this to false.

      If the IRE state on entry is IRE_CONSTRUCTED, this method changes
      it to IRE_LAUNCHED; otherwise, it throws an exception.
      When the Python code finishes its initialization, it will call a
      callback function to change the state to IRE_ACTIVE prior to entering
      the wxPython main event loop.  On exit from the event loop, it will
      call the callback function to change the state to IRE_FINISHED. */
